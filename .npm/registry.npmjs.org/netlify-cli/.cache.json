The new 2.0 version (now in beta) was rebuilt from the ground up to help improve the site building experience.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (TOC:collapse=true&collapseText=Click to expand) -->\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\n\n- [Install & Setup](#install--setup)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  * [Link to an existing site](#link-to-an-existing-site)\n  * [Create a new site](#create-a-new-site)\n  * [Deploying a site](#deploying-a-site)\n  * [Production Deploys](#production-deploys)\n- [Full Command Reference](#full-command-reference)\n  * [deploy](#deploy)\n  * [init](#init)\n  * [link](#link)\n  * [login](#login)\n  * [logout](#logout)\n  * [open](#open)\n  * [sites](#sites)\n  * [status](#status)\n  * [unlink](#unlink)\n  * [watch](#watch)\n  * [telemetry](#telemetry)\n- [Local Development](#local-development)\n\n</details>\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n## Install & Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 8+.\n- [Netlify User Account](http://app.netlify.com/)\n\nTo install the Netlify CLI, run the following command in your terminal window:\n\n```sh-session\nnpm install netlify-cli@beta -g\n```\n\nAfter installing the CLI globally, connect the CLI to your Netlify account with the following command:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify login\n```\n\nThis will open a browser window, asking you to log in with Netlify and grant access to **Netlify CLI**. This will store your Netlify access token in your home folder, under `~/.netlify/config.json`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify [command]\n\n# Run `help` for detailed information about CLI commands\nnetlify [command] help\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Netlify's continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment) will automatically deploy new versions of your site when you push commits to your connected Git repository.\n\nTo setup continuous deployment with the CLI, run:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nIn order to connect your repository for continuous deployment, Netlify CLI will need access to create a deploy key and a webhook on the github repository. When you run the command above, you'll be prompted to log in to your GitHub account, which will create an account-level access token.\n\nThe access token will be stored in your home folder, under `.netlify/config.json`. Your login password will never be stored. You can revoke the access token at any time from your GitHub account settings.\n\n\n### Link to an existing site\n\nLinking to a site tells Netlify CLI which site the current directory should deploy to. To do this, run the following command from the base of your project directory:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify link\n```\n\nThis will add a `siteId` field to a new file inside your project folder, at `.netlify/state.json`. To unlink your folder from the site, you can remove this field, or you can run the following command from inside the project folder:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify unlink\n```\n\n\n### Create a new site\n\nTo create a new Netlify site with the CLI, run the `netlify init` command in your site folder.\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nThen Choose \"Create & configure a new site in Netlify\"\n\nProceed through the prompts to finish configuring your site.\n\n### Deploying a site\n\nIt's also possible to deploy a site manually, without continuous deployment. This method uploads files directly from your local project directory to your site on Netlify.\n\nA common use case for this command is when you're using a separate Continuous Integration (CI) tool, deploying prebuilt files to Netlify at the end of the CI tool tasks.\n\n**To do a manual deployment with the CLI run:**\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify deploy\n\n# Optionally pass in the build directory\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory\n\n# Deploying to production with --prod flag\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory --prod\n```\n\nThis `deploy` command needs to know which folder to publish, and if your project includes functions, a functions folder to deploy. It will look for this information in three places, in the following order:\n\n* in flags specified in the command itself\n* in a [netlify.toml file](https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference) stored at the base of your project directory.\n* in your site settings in the Netlify UI.\n\n\n### Production Deploys\n\nBy default, all `deploys` are set to a draft preview URL.\n\nTo do a manual deploy to production, use the `--prod` flag:\n\n```sh-session\n# Deploy build folder to production\nnetlify deploy --prod\n\n# Shorthand -p\nnetlify deploy -p\n```\n\nDeploying to production will publish the build directory at the live URL of your Netlify site.\n\n## Full Command Reference\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_COMMANDS_LIST) -->\n### [deploy](/docs/commands/deploy.md)\n\nCreate a new deploy from the contents of a folder\n\n### [init](/docs/commands/init.md)\n\nConfigure continuous deployment for a new or existing site\n\n### [link](/docs/commands/link.md)\n\nLink a local repo or project folder to an existing site on Netlify\n\n### [login](/docs/commands/login.md)\n\nLogin to your Netlify account\n\n### [logout](/docs/commands/logout.md)\n\nLogout of your Netlify account\n\n### [open](/docs/commands/open.md)\n\nOpen settings for the site linked to the current folder\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`open:admin`](/docs/commands/open.md#openadmin) | Opens current site admin UI in Netlify  |\n| [`open:site`](/docs/commands/open.md#opensite) | Opens current site url in browser  |\n\n\n### [sites](/docs/commands/sites.md)\n\nHandle various site operations\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`sites:create`](/docs/commands/sites.md#sitescreate) | Create an empty site (advanced)  |\n| [`sites:list`](/docs/commands/sites.md#siteslist) | List all sites you have access too  |\n\n\n### [status](/docs/commands/status.md)\n\nPrint status information\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`status:hooks`](/docs/commands/status.md#statushooks) | Print hook information of the linked site  |\n\n\n### [unlink](/docs/commands/unlink.md)\n\nUnlink a local folder from a Netlify site\n\n### [watch](/docs/commands/watch.md)\n\nWatch for site deploy to finish\n\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n### telemetry\n\nBy default, the CLI collects usage stats from logged in Netlify users. This is to constantly improve the developer experience of the tool and bake in better features.\n\nIf you'd like to opt out of sending telemetry data, you can do so with the `--telemetry-disable` flag\n\n```sh-session\n# opt out of telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-disable\n\n# turn on telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-enable\n```\n\nOr edit the `telemetryDisabled` property of the `~/.netlify/config.json` file in your computers root directory.\n\n\n# Local Development\n\n1. Clone down the repo\n\n```sh-session\n$ git clone git@github.com:netlify/cli.git\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm install\n```\n\n3. Run CLI locally during development\n\n```sh-session\n$ ./bin/run [command]\n```\n\nWhen developing, you can use watch mode which will automatically run ava tests:\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm run watch\n```\n\n[0]: https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg\n[1]: https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index\n[2]:

It will look for this information in three places, in the following order:\n\n* in flags specified in the command itself\n* in a [netlify.toml file](https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference) stored at the base of your project directory.\n* in your site settings in the Netlify UI.\n\n\n### Production Deploys\n\nBy default, all `deploys` are set to a draft preview URL.\n\nTo do a manual deploy to production, use the `--prod` flag:\n\n```sh-session\n# Deploy build folder to production\nnetlify deploy --prod\n\n# Shorthand -p\nnetlify deploy -p\n```\n\nDeploying to production will publish the build directory at the live URL of your Netlify site.\n\n## Full Command Reference\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_COMMANDS_LIST) -->\n### [deploy](/docs/commands/deploy.md)\n\nCreate a new deploy from the contents of a folder\n\n### [init](/docs/commands/init.md)\n\nConfigure continuous deployment for a new or existing site\n\n### [link](/docs/commands/link.md)\n\nLink a local repo or project folder to an existing site on Netlify\n\n### [login](/docs/commands/login.md)\n\nLogin to your Netlify account\n\n### [logout](/docs/commands/logout.md)\n\nLogout of your Netlify account\n\n### [open](/docs/commands/open.md)\n\nOpen settings for the site linked to the current folder\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`open:admin`](/docs/commands/open.md#openadmin) | Opens current site admin UI in Netlify  |\n| [`open:site`](/docs/commands/open.md#opensite) | Opens current site url in browser  |\n\n\n### [sites](/docs/commands/sites.md)\n\nHandle various site operations\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`sites:create`](/docs/commands/sites.md#sitescreate) | Create an empty site (advanced)  |\n| [`sites:list`](/docs/commands/sites.md#siteslist) | List all sites you have access too  |\n\n\n### [status](/docs/commands/status.md)\n\nPrint status information\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`status:hooks`](/docs/commands/status.md#statushooks) | Print hook information of the linked site  |\n\n\n### [unlink](/docs/commands/unlink.md)\n\nUnlink a local folder from a Netlify site\n\n### [watch](/docs/commands/watch.md)\n\nWatch for site deploy to finish\n\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n### telemetry\n\nBy default, the CLI collects usage stats from logged in Netlify users. This is to constantly improve the developer experience of the tool and bake in better features.\n\nIf you'd like to opt out of sending telemetry data, you can do so with the `--telemetry-disable` flag\n\n```sh-session\n# opt out of telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-disable\n\n# turn on telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-enable\n```\n\nOr edit the `telemetryDisabled` property of the `~/.netlify/config.json` file in your computers root directory.\n\n\n# Local Development\n\n1. Clone down the repo\n\n```sh-session\n$ git clone git@github.com:netlify/cli.git\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm install\n```\n\n3. Run CLI locally during development\n\n```sh-session\n$ ./bin/run [command]\n```\n\nWhen developing, you can use watch mode which will automatically run ava tests:\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm run watch\n```\n\n[0]: https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg\n[1]: https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index\n[2]:

[![dependencies][david-img]][david] [![downloads][dl-img]][dl]\n\nWelcome to the Netlify CLI! The new 2.0 version (now in beta) was rebuilt from the ground up to help improve the site building experience.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (TOC:collapse=true&collapseText=Click to expand) -->\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\n\n- [Install & Setup](#install--setup)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  * [Link to an existing site](#link-to-an-existing-site)\n  * [Create a new site](#create-a-new-site)\n  * [Deploying a site](#deploying-a-site)\n  * [Production Deploys](#production-deploys)\n- [Full Command Reference](#full-command-reference)\n  * [deploy](#deploy)\n  * [init](#init)\n  * [link](#link)\n  * [login](#login)\n  * [logout](#logout)\n  * [open](#open)\n  * [sites](#sites)\n  * [status](#status)\n  * [unlink](#unlink)\n  * [watch](#watch)\n  * [telemetry](#telemetry)\n- [Local Development](#local-development)\n\n</details>\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n## Install & Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 8+.\n- [Netlify User Account](http://app.netlify.com/)\n\nTo install the Netlify CLI, run the following command in your terminal window:\n\n```sh-session\nnpm install netlify-cli@next -g\n```\n\nAfter installing the CLI globally, connect the CLI to your Netlify account with the following command:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify login\n```\n\nThis will open a browser window, asking you to log in with Netlify and grant access to **Netlify CLI**. This will store your Netlify access token in your home folder, under `~/.netlify/config.json`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify [command]\n\n# Run `help` for detailed information about CLI commands\nnetlify [command] help\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Netlify's continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment) will automatically deploy new versions of your site when you push commits to your connected Git repository.\n\nTo setup continuous deployment with the CLI, run:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nIn order to connect your repository for continuous deployment, Netlify CLI will need access to create a deploy key and a webhook on the github repository. When you run the command above, you'll be prompted to log in to your GitHub account, which will create an account-level access token.\n\nThe access token will be stored in your home folder, under `.netlify/config.json`. Your login password will never be stored. You can revoke the access token at any time from your GitHub account settings.\n\n\n### Link to an existing site\n\nLinking to a site tells Netlify CLI which site the current directory should deploy to. To do this, run the following command from the base of your project directory:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify link\n```\n\nThis will add a `siteId` field to a new file inside your project folder, at `.netlify/state.json`. To unlink your folder from the site, you can remove this field, or you can run the following command from inside the project folder:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify unlink\n```\n\n\n### Create a new site\n\nTo create a new Netlify site with the CLI, run the `netlify init` command in your site folder.\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nThen Choose \"Create & configure a new site in Netlify\"\n\nProceed through the prompts to finish configuring your site.\n\n### Deploying a site\n\nIt's also possible to deploy a site manually, without continuous deployment. This method uploads files directly from your local project directory to your site on Netlify.\n\nA common use case for this command is when you're using a separate Continuous Integration (CI) tool, deploying prebuilt files to Netlify at the end of the CI tool tasks.\n\n**To do a manual deployment with the CLI run:**\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify deploy\n\n# Optionally pass in the build directory\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory\n\n# Deploying to production with --prod flag\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory --prod\n```\n\nThis `deploy` command needs to know which folder to publish, and if your project includes functions, a functions folder to deploy.

The new 2.0 version (now in beta) was rebuilt from the ground up to help improve the site building experience.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (TOC:collapse=true&collapseText=Click to expand) -->\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\n\n- [Install & Setup](#install--setup)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  * [Link to an existing site](#link-to-an-existing-site)\n  * [Create a new site](#create-a-new-site)\n  * [Deploying a site](#deploying-a-site)\n  * [Production Deploys](#production-deploys)\n- [Full Command Reference](#full-command-reference)\n  * [deploy](#deploy)\n  * [init](#init)\n  * [link](#link)\n  * [login](#login)\n  * [logout](#logout)\n  * [open](#open)\n  * [sites](#sites)\n  * [status](#status)\n  * [unlink](#unlink)\n  * [watch](#watch)\n  * [telemetry](#telemetry)\n- [Local Development](#local-development)\n\n</details>\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n## Install & Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 8+.\n- [Netlify User Account](http://app.netlify.com/)\n\nTo install the Netlify CLI, run the following command in your terminal window:\n\n```sh-session\nnpm install netlify-cli@next -g\n```\n\nAfter installing the CLI globally, connect the CLI to your Netlify account with the following command:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify login\n```\n\nThis will open a browser window, asking you to log in with Netlify and grant access to **Netlify CLI**. This will store your Netlify access token in your home folder, under `~/.netlify/config.json`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify [command]\n\n# Run `help` for detailed information about CLI commands\nnetlify [command] help\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Netlify's continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment) will automatically deploy new versions of your site when you push commits to your connected Git repository.\n\nTo setup continuous deployment with the CLI, run:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nIn order to connect your repository for continuous deployment, Netlify CLI will need access to create a deploy key and a webhook on the github repository. When you run the command above, you'll be prompted to log in to your GitHub account, which will create an account-level access token.\n\nThe access token will be stored in your home folder, under `.netlify/config.json`. Your login password will never be stored. You can revoke the access token at any time from your GitHub account settings.\n\n\n### Link to an existing site\n\nLinking to a site tells Netlify CLI which site the current directory should deploy to. To do this, run the following command from the base of your project directory:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify link\n```\n\nThis will add a `siteId` field to a new file inside your project folder, at `.netlify/state.json`. To unlink your folder from the site, you can remove this field, or you can run the following command from inside the project folder:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify unlink\n```\n\n\n### Create a new site\n\nTo create a new Netlify site with the CLI, run the `netlify init` command in your site folder.\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nThen Choose \"Create & configure a new site in Netlify\"\n\nProceed through the prompts to finish configuring your site.\n\n### Deploying a site\n\nIt's also possible to deploy a site manually, without continuous deployment. This method uploads files directly from your local project directory to your site on Netlify.\n\nA common use case for this command is when you're using a separate Continuous Integration (CI) tool, deploying prebuilt files to Netlify at the end of the CI tool tasks.\n\n**To do a manual deployment with the CLI run:**\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify deploy\n\n# Optionally pass in the build directory\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory\n\n# Deploying to production with --prod flag\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory --prod\n```\n\nThis `deploy` command needs to know which folder to publish, and if your project includes functions, a functions folder to deploy. It will look for this information in three places, in the following order:\n\n* in flags specified in the command itself\n* in a [netlify.toml file](https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference) stored at the base of your project directory.\n* in your site settings in the Netlify UI.\n\n\n### Production Deploys\n\nBy default, all `deploys` are set to a draft preview URL.\n\nTo do a manual deploy to production, use the `--prod` flag:\n\n```sh-session\n# Deploy build folder to production\nnetlify deploy --prod\n\n# Shorthand -p\nnetlify deploy -p\n```\n\nDeploying to production will publish the build directory at the live URL of your Netlify site.\n\n## Full Command Reference\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_COMMANDS_LIST) -->\n### [deploy](/docs/commands/deploy.md)\n\nCreate a new deploy from the contents of a folder\n\n### [init](/docs/commands/init.md)\n\nConfigure continuous deployment for a new or existing site\n\n### [link](/docs/commands/link.md)\n\nLink a local repo or project folder to an existing site on Netlify\n\n### [login](/docs/commands/login.md)\n\nLogin to your Netlify account\n\n### [logout](/docs/commands/logout.md)\n\nLogout of your Netlify account\n\n### [open](/docs/commands/open.md)\n\nOpen settings for the site linked to the current folder\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`open:admin`](/docs/commands/open.md#openadmin) | Opens current site admin UI in Netlify  |\n| [`open:site`](/docs/commands/open.md#opensite) | Opens current site url in browser  |\n\n\n### [sites](/docs/commands/sites.md)\n\nHandle various site operations\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`sites:create`](/docs/commands/sites.md#sitescreate) | Create an empty site (advanced)  |\n| [`sites:list`](/docs/commands/sites.md#siteslist) | List all sites you have access too  |\n\n\n### [status](/docs/commands/status.md)\n\nPrint status information\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`status:hooks`](/docs/commands/status.md#statushooks) | Print hook information of the linked site  |\n\n\n### [unlink](/docs/commands/unlink.md)\n\nUnlink a local folder from a Netlify site\n\n### [watch](/docs/commands/watch.md)\n\nWatch for site deploy to finish\n\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n### telemetry\n\nBy default, the CLI collects usage stats from logged in Netlify users. This is to constantly improve the developer experience of the tool and bake in better features.\n\nIf you'd like to opt out of sending telemetry data, you can do so with the `--telemetry-disable` flag\n\n```sh-session\n# opt out of telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-disable\n\n# turn on telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-enable\n```\n\nOr edit the `telemetryDisabled` property of the `~/.netlify/config.json` file in your computers root directory.\n\n\n# Local Development\n\n1. Clone down the repo\n\n```sh-session\n$ git clone git@github.com:netlify/cli.git\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm install\n```\n\n3. Run CLI locally during development\n\n```sh-session\n$ ./bin/run [command]\n```\n\nWhen developing, you can use watch mode which will automatically run ava tests:\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm run watch\n```\n[npm-img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/netlify-cli.svg\n[npm]: https://npmjs.org/package/netlify-cli\n[travis-img]: https://img.shields.io/travis/netlify/cli/master.svg\n[travis]:

[![dependencies][david-img]][david] [![downloads][dl-img]][dl]\n\nWelcome to the Netlify CLI! The new 2.0 version (now in beta) was rebuilt from the ground up to help improve the site building experience.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (TOC:collapse=true&collapseText=Click to expand) -->\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\n\n- [Install & Setup](#install--setup)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  * [Link to an existing site](#link-to-an-existing-site)\n  * [Create a new site](#create-a-new-site)\n  * [Deploying a site](#deploying-a-site)\n  * [Production Deploys](#production-deploys)\n- [Full Command Reference](#full-command-reference)\n  * [deploy](#deploy)\n  * [init](#init)\n  * [link](#link)\n  * [login](#login)\n  * [logout](#logout)\n  * [open](#open)\n  * [sites](#sites)\n  * [status](#status)\n  * [unlink](#unlink)\n  * [watch](#watch)\n  * [telemetry](#telemetry)\n- [Local Development](#local-development)\n\n</details>\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n## Install & Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 8+.\n- [Netlify User Account](http://app.netlify.com/)\n\nTo install the Netlify CLI, run the following command in your terminal window:\n\n```sh-session\nnpm install netlify-cli@next -g\n```\n\nAfter installing the CLI globally, connect the CLI to your Netlify account with the following command:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify login\n```\n\nThis will open a browser window, asking you to log in with Netlify and grant access to **Netlify CLI**. This will store your Netlify access token in your home folder, under `~/.netlify/config.json`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify [command]\n\n# Run `help` for detailed information about CLI commands\nnetlify [command] help\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[Netlify's continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment) will automatically deploy new versions of your site when you push commits to your connected Git repository.\n\nTo setup continuous deployment with the CLI, run:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nIn order to connect your repository for continuous deployment, Netlify CLI will need access to create a deploy key and a webhook on the github repository. When you run the command above, you'll be prompted to log in to your GitHub account, which will create an account-level access token.\n\nThe access token will be stored in your home folder, under `.netlify/config.json`. Your login password will never be stored. You can revoke the access token at any time from your GitHub account settings.\n\n\n### Link to an existing site\n\nLinking to a site tells Netlify CLI which site the current directory should deploy to. To do this, run the following command from the base of your project directory:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify link\n```\n\nThis will add a `siteId` field to a new file inside your project folder, at `.netlify/state.json`. To unlink your folder from the site, you can remove this field, or you can run the following command from inside the project folder:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify unlink\n```\n\n\n### Create a new site\n\nTo create a new Netlify site with the CLI, run the `netlify init` command in your site folder.\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify init\n```\n\nThen Choose \"Create & configure a new site in Netlify\"\n\nProceed through the prompts to finish configuring your site.\n\n### Deploying a site\n\nIt's also possible to deploy a site manually, without continuous deployment. This method uploads files directly from your local project directory to your site on Netlify.\n\nA common use case for this command is when you're using a separate Continuous Integration (CI) tool, deploying prebuilt files to Netlify at the end of the CI tool tasks.\n\n**To do a manual deployment with the CLI run:**\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify deploy\n\n# Optionally pass in the build directory\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory\n\n# Deploying to production with --prod flag\nnetlify deploy --dir your-build-directory --prod\n```\n\nThis `deploy` command needs to know which folder to publish, and if your project includes functions, a functions folder to deploy. It will look for this information in three places, in the following order:\n\n* in flags specified in the command itself\n* in a [netlify.toml file](https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference) stored at the base of your project directory.\n* in your site settings in the Netlify UI.\n\n\n### Production Deploys\n\nBy default, all `deploys` are set to a draft preview URL.\n\nTo do a manual deploy to production, use the `--prod` flag:\n\n```sh-session\n# Deploy build folder to production\nnetlify deploy --prod\n\n# Shorthand -p\nnetlify deploy -p\n```\n\nDeploying to production will publish the build directory at the live URL of your Netlify site.\n\n## Full Command Reference\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_COMMANDS_LIST) -->\n### [deploy](/docs/commands/deploy.md)\n\nCreate a new deploy from the contents of a folder\n\n### [init](/docs/commands/init.md)\n\nConfigure continuous deployment for a new or existing site\n\n### [link](/docs/commands/link.md)\n\nLink a local repo or project folder to an existing site on Netlify\n\n### [login](/docs/commands/login.md)\n\nLogin to your Netlify account\n\n### [logout](/docs/commands/logout.md)\n\nLogout of your Netlify account\n\n### [open](/docs/commands/open.md)\n\nOpen settings for the site linked to the current folder\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`open:admin`](/docs/commands/open.md#openadmin) | Opens current site admin UI in Netlify  |\n| [`open:site`](/docs/commands/open.md#opensite) | Opens current site url in browser  |\n\n\n### [sites](/docs/commands/sites.md)\n\nHandle various site operations\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`sites:create`](/docs/commands/sites.md#sitescreate) | Create an empty site (advanced)  |\n| [`sites:list`](/docs/commands/sites.md#siteslist) | List all sites you have access too  |\n\n\n### [status](/docs/commands/status.md)\n\nPrint status information\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`status:hooks`](/docs/commands/status.md#statushooks) | Print hook information of the linked site  |\n\n\n### [unlink](/docs/commands/unlink.md)\n\nUnlink a local folder from a Netlify site\n\n### [watch](/docs/commands/watch.md)\n\nWatch for site deploy to finish\n\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n### telemetry\n\nBy default, the CLI collects usage stats from logged in Netlify users. This is to constantly improve the developer experience of the tool and bake in better features.\n\nIf you'd like to opt out of sending telemetry data, you can do so with the `--telemetry-disable` flag\n\n```sh-session\n# opt out of telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-disable\n\n# turn on telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-enable\n```\n\nOr edit the `telemetryDisabled` property of the `~/.netlify/config.json` file in your computers root directory.\n\n\n# Local Development\n\n1. Clone down the repo\n\n```sh-session\n$ git clone git@github.com:netlify/cli.git\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm install\n```\n\n3. Run CLI locally during development\n\n```sh-session\n$ ./bin/run [command]\n```\n\nWhen developing, you can use watch mode which will automatically run ava tests:\n\n```sh-session\n$ npm run watch\n```\n[npm-img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/netlify-cli.svg\n[npm]: https://npmjs.org/package/netlify-cli\n[travis-img]: https://img.shields.io/travis/netlify/cli/master.svg\n[travis]:

The new 2.0 version (now in beta) was rebuilt from the ground up to help improve the site building experience.\n\n- See our [Getting Started Guide](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/) for a comprehensive introduction to the CLI.\n- See the [CLI website](http://cli.netlify.com/) for online access to CLI help text.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (TOC:collapse=true&collapseText=Click to expand) -->\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  * [CI and Environment Variables.](#ci-and-environment-variables)\n- [Getting Started + Docs](#getting-started--docs)\n- [Full Command Reference](#full-command-reference)\n  * [deploy](#deploy)\n  * [init](#init)\n  * [link](#link)\n  * [login](#login)\n  * [logout](#logout)\n  * [open](#open)\n  * [sites](#sites)\n  * [status](#status)\n  * [unlink](#unlink)\n  * [watch](#watch)\n  * [telemetry](#telemetry)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n</details>\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n## Installation\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 8+.\n- [Netlify User Account](http://app.netlify.com/)\n\nTo install the Netlify CLI, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```sh-session\nnpm install netlify-cli@next -g\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installing the CLI globally, connect the CLI to your Netlify account with the following command:\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify login\n```\n\nThis will open a browser window, asking you to log in with Netlify and grant access to **Netlify CLI**. This will store your Netlify access token in your home folder, under `~/.netlify/config.json`.\n\n```sh-session\nnetlify [command]\n\n# Run `help` for detailed information about CLI commands\nnetlify [command] help\n```\n\n### CI and Environment Variables.\n\nThe following environment variables can be used to override configuration file lookups and prompts:\n\n- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - an access token to use when authenticating commands. **KEEP THIS VALUE PRIVATE**\n- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - override any linked site in the current working directory.\n\n## Getting Started + Docs\n\nPlease see the getting started guide on our docs website:\n\n- [netlify.com/docs/cli](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli)\n\n<!-- TODO: Grab a screenshot to make it pop more -->\n\n## Full Command Reference\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_COMMANDS_LIST) -->\n### [deploy](/docs/commands/deploy.md)\n\nCreate a new deploy from the contents of a folder\n\n### [init](/docs/commands/init.md)\n\nConfigure continuous deployment for a new or existing site\n\n### [link](/docs/commands/link.md)\n\nLink a local repo or project folder to an existing site on Netlify\n\n### [login](/docs/commands/login.md)\n\nLogin to your Netlify account\n\n### [logout](/docs/commands/logout.md)\n\nLogout of your Netlify account\n\n### [open](/docs/commands/open.md)\n\nOpen settings for the site linked to the current folder\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`open:admin`](/docs/commands/open.md#openadmin) | Opens current site admin UI in Netlify  |\n| [`open:site`](/docs/commands/open.md#opensite) | Opens current site url in browser  |\n\n\n### [sites](/docs/commands/sites.md)\n\nHandle various site operations\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`sites:create`](/docs/commands/sites.md#sitescreate) | Create an empty site (advanced)  |\n| [`sites:list`](/docs/commands/sites.md#siteslist) | List all sites you have access too  |\n\n\n### [status](/docs/commands/status.md)\n\nPrint status information\n\n| Subcommand | description  |\n|:--------------------------- |:-----|\n| [`status:hooks`](/docs/commands/status.md#statushooks) | Print hook information of the linked site  |\n\n\n### [unlink](/docs/commands/unlink.md)\n\nUnlink a local folder from a Netlify site\n\n### [watch](/docs/commands/watch.md)\n\nWatch for site deploy to finish\n\n\n<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->\n\n### telemetry\n\nBy default, the CLI collects usage stats from logged in Netlify users. This is to constantly improve the developer experience of the tool and bake in better features.\n\nIf you'd like to opt out of sending telemetry data, you can do so with the `--telemetry-disable` flag\n\n```sh-session\n# opt out of telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-disable\n\n# turn on telemetry\nnetlify --telemetry-enable\n```\n\nOr edit the `telemetryDisabled` property of the `~/.netlify/config.json` file in your computers root directory.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info on how to make contributions to this project.\n\n## License\n\nMIT.
