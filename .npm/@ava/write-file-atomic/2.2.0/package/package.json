Finally it renames the file back to the filename you specified. If\nit encounters errors at any of these steps it will attempt to unlink the temporary file and then\npass the error back to the caller.\n\nIf provided, the **chown** option requires both **uid** and **gid** properties or else\nyou'll get an error.\n\nThe **encoding** option is ignored if **data** is a buffer. It defaults to 'utf8'.\n\nIf the **fsync** option is **false**, writeFile will skip the final fsync call.\n\nThe callback is always invoked with the initial (temporary) filename.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nwriteFileAtomic('message.txt', 'Hello Node', {chown:{uid:100,gid:50}}, function (err) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log('It\\'s saved!');\n});\n```\n\n### var writeFileAtomicSync = require('write-file-atomic').sync<br>writeFileAtomicSync(filename, data, [options])\n\nThe synchronous version of **writeFileAtomic**. Returns the initial (temporary) filename.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"@ava/write-file-atomic@2.2.0","_shasum":"d625046f3495f1f5e372135f473909684b429247","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/@ava/write-file-atomic/-/write-file-atomic-2.2.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/@ava/write-file-atomic/-/write-file-atomic-2.2.0.tgz"}
