Now I'm beginning to see it with AVA too, so would be nice to be preemptive about it.\n>\n> People don't realize they need to wrap their call in a function, so many end up doing `t.throws(foo())` instead of `t.throws(() => foo());`. It's an easy mistake to make.\n\nThe difficulty is that `t.throws(foo())` is allowed if `foo()` returns a promise or a function. There is no good way to differentiate between the two at runtime. So providing a good error message is going to take some AST transform magic.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nSee [`test.js.md`](test.js.md) for the transformation this plugin performs.\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [James Talmage](https://github.com/jamestalmage)\n","readmeFilename":"readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/avajs/babel-plugin-throws-helper/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/avajs/babel-plugin-throws-helper#readme","_id":"@ava/babel-plugin-throws-helper@3.0.0","_shasum":"2c933ec22da0c4ce1fc5369f2b95452c70420586","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/@ava/babel-plugin-throws-helper/-/babel-plugin-throws-helper-3.0.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/@ava/babel-plugin-throws-helper/-/babel-plugin-throws-helper-3.0.0.tgz"}
