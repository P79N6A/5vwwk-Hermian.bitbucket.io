All dependencies used in the code are listed in package.json\n$ dependency-check ./package.json --unused\nSuccess! All dependencies in package.json are used in the code\n```\n\n`dependency-check` exits with code 1 if there are discrepancies, in addition to printing them out\n\nTo always exit with code 0 pass `--ignore`\n\n### --missing (default)\n\nrunning `dependency-check ./package.json` will check to make sure that all modules in your code are listed in your package.json\n\n### --unused, --extra\n\nrunning `dependency-check ./package.json --unused` will do the inverse of the default missing check and will tell you which modules in your package.json dependencies **were not used** in your code\n\n### --no-dev\n\nrunning `dependency-check ./package.json --unused --no-dev` will not tell you if any devDependencies in your package.json were missing or unused\n\n### --no-peer\n\nrunning `dependency-check ./package.json --unused --no-peer` will not tell you if any peerDependencies in your package.json were missing or unused\n\n### --ignore-module, -i\n\nignores a module. This works for both `--unused` and `--missing`. You can specify as many separate `--ignore-module` arguments as you want. For example running `dependency-check ./package.json --unused --ignore-module foo` will not tell you if the `foo` module was not used in your code. \n\n### --entry\n\nby default your `main` and `bin` entries from package.json will be parsed, but you can add more the list of entries by passing them in as `--entry`, e.g.:\n\n```\ndependency-check package.json --entry tests.js\n```\n\nin the above example `tests.js` will get added to the entries that get parsed + checked in addition to the defaults. You can specify as many separate `--entry` arguments as you want\n\nyou can also instead add additional entries directly after your package definition, like:\n\n```\ndependency-check package.json tests.js\n```\n\n### --no-default-entries\n\nrunning `dependency-check package.json --no-default-entries --entry tests.js` won't parse any entries other than `tests.js`.  None of the entries from your package.json `main` and `bin` will be parsed\n\n### --extensions, -e\n\nrunning `dependency-check ./package.json -e js,jsx:precinct` will resolve require paths to `.js` and `.jsx` paths, and parse using [`precinct`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/precinct).\n\n### --detective\n\nrunning `dependency-check ./package.json --detective precinct` will `require()` the local `precinct` as the default parser. This can be set per-extension using using `-e`. Defaults to parsing with [`detective`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detective).\n\n### --quiet\n\nRunning with `--quiet` will diable the default log message on success, so that dependency-check only logs on failure.\n\n### --help\n\nshows above options and all other available options\n\n## auto check before every npm publish\n\nadd this to your `.bash_profile`/`.bashrc`\n\n```sh\n# originally from https://gist.github.com/mafintosh/405048d304fbabb830b2\nnpm () {\n  ([ \"$1\" != \"publish\" ] || dependency-check .) && command npm \"$@\"\n}\n```\n\nnow when you do `npm publish` and you have missing dependencies it won't publish, e.g.:\n\n```\n$ npm publish\nFail! Dependencies not listed in package.json: siblings\n$ npm install --save siblings\n$ npm publish # works this time\n```\n\n## grunt usage\n\nSee [grunt-dependency-check](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-dependency-check).\n\n## protips\n\n- [detective](https://www.npmjs.org/package/detective) is used for parsing `require()` statements, which means it only does **static requires**. this means you should convert things like `var foo = \"bar\"; require(foo)` to be static, e.g. `require(\"bar\")`\n- you can specify as many entry points as you like with multiple `--entry foo.js` arguments\n","readmeFilename":"readme.md","_id":"dependency-check@3.3.0","_shasum":"0221c7222514c06e22b92154ad1a4aa949aea070","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/dependency-check/-/dependency-check-3.3.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/dependency-check/-/dependency-check-3.3.0.tgz"}
