While many terminals have long detected URL's and linkified them, allowing you to Command-Click or Control-Click them to open a browser, you were forced to print the long unsightly URL's on the screen. As of spring 2017 [a few terminals](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) began supporting HTML like links, where the link text and destination could be specified separately.\n\nThis module allows you to detect if hyperlinks are supported in the current Terminal.\n\nAs this is a new development, we anticipate the list of supported Terminals to grow rapidly. Please open an issue or submit a PR as new Terminals implement support.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install supports-hyperlinks\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst supportsHyperlinks = require('supports-hyperlinks');\n\nif (supportsHyperlinks.stdout) {\n\tconsole.log('Terminal stdout supports hyperlinks');\n}\n\nif (supportsHyperlinks.stderr) {\n\tconsole.log('Terminal stderr supports hyperlinks');\n}\n```\n\n## API\n\nReturns an `Object` with a `stdout` and `stderr` property for testing either streams. Each property is a `boolean`, indicating whether or not hyperlinks are supported.\n\n## Info\n\nObeys the `--no-hyperlinks`, `--hyperlink=always`, and `--hyperlink=never` CLI flags.\n\nCan be overridden by the user with the flags `--hyperlinks=always` and `--no-hyperlinks`. For situations where using those flags are not possible, add the environment variable `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1` to forcefully enable hyperlinks or `FORCE_HYPERLINK=0` to forcefully disable. The use of `FORCE_HYPERLINK` overrides all other hyperlink support checks.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [James Talmage](https://github.com/jamestalmage)\n","readmeFilename":"readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/supports-hyperlinks/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/supports-hyperlinks#readme","_id":"supports-hyperlinks@1.0.1","_shasum":"71daedf36cc1060ac5100c351bb3da48c29c0ef7","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/supports-hyperlinks/-/supports-hyperlinks-1.0.1.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/supports-hyperlinks/-/supports-hyperlinks-1.0.1.tgz"}
