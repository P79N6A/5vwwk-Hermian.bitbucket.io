Based on the awesome work of [@remixz](https://github.com/remixz) as part of [publish-release](https://github.com/remixz/publish-release).\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install gh-release-assets\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nPass in the upload url and an array of local files you'd like to upload. If you want to specify a new name for the file once it is uploaded, use an object with a `name` and `path` keys.\n\n```js\nvar ghReleaseAssets = require('gh-release-assets')\n\nghReleaseAssets({\n  url: 'https://uploads.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/releases/1197692/assets{?name}',\n  token: [MY_GITHUB_TOKEN],\n  assets: [\n    '/path/to/foo.txt',\n    '/path/to/bar.zip',\n    {\n      name: 'baz.txt',\n      path: '/path/to/baz.txt'\n    }\n  ]\n}, function (err, assets) {\n  console.log(assets)\n})\n```\n\nGitHub returns the upload url in the correct format after you create a release as `upload_url`. You can also get the upload url from the `releases` endpoint like:\n\n```\ncurl -i https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/releases\n```\n\nYou can also use a username/password instead of a token by passing an `auth` object:\n\n```js\nvar ghReleaseAssets = require('gh-release-assets')\n\nghReleaseAssets({\n  url: 'https://uploads.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/releases/1197692/assets{?name}',\n  auth: {\n    username: 'CoolGuy'\n    password: 'KeepItSecret'\n  },\n  assets: [\n    '/path/to/foo.txt',\n    '/path/to/bar.zip',\n    {\n      name: 'baz.txt',\n      path: '/path/to/baz.txt'\n    }\n  ]\n}, function (err, assets) {\n  console.log(assets)\n})\n```\n\nEither a `token` or `auth` is required.\n\n`gh-release-assets` also emits the following events:\n\n* `upload-asset` - `{name}` - Emits before an asset file starts uploading. Emits the `name` of the file.\n* `upload-progress` - `{name, progress}` - Emits while a file is uploading. Emits the `name` of the file, and a `progress` object from [`progress-stream`](https://github.com/freeall/progress-stream).\n* `uploaded-asset` - `{name}` - Emits after an asset file is successfully uploaded. Emits the `name` of the file.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
