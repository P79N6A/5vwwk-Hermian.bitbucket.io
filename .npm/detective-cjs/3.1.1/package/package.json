Yes, but I needed the capability to reuse an AST\nand this was unlikely to be merged timely. I can also support jsx and other syntactic constructs faster.\n\n### Usage\n\n```js\nvar detective = require('detective-cjs');\n\nvar mySourceCode = fs.readFileSync('myfile.js', 'utf8');\n\n// Pass in a file's content or an AST\nvar dependencies = detective(mySourceCode);\n\n```\n\n* Supports JSX, ES7, and any other features that [node-source-walk](https://github.com/mrjoelkemp/node-source-walk) supports.\n\n#### License\n\nMIT\n","readmeFilename":"Readme.md","_id":"detective-cjs@3.1.1","_shasum":"18da3e39a002d2098a1123d45ce1de1b0d9045a0","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/detective-cjs/-/detective-cjs-3.1.1.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/detective-cjs/-/detective-cjs-3.1.1.tgz"}
